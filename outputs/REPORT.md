# Experiment 1 – Archerfish Analysis

This project analyses behavioural data from Experiment 1.
Generated outputs include:
- Learning curves (accuracy per session, per fish, for each target numerosity)
- Bar plot of choices (target × color combinations)
- Target-accuracy by factor (geometry/disposition) with chance & criterion lines, plus LR tests

Figures are saved in `outputs/figures/`.
