# Archerfish Experiment 1 Analysis

This project provides a Python pipeline to analyze data from **Experiment 1**.  
The focus is on how individual fish learn to associate specific colors with target numerosities.

## Project structure
- `scripts/run_analysis.py` → main entry point to run the analysis.
- `src/archerfish/` → helper modules (I/O, preprocessing, plotting).
- `config/config.yaml` → configuration file (data path and color mapping).
- `data/` → place your Excel file with the raw data.
- `outputs/` → figures and reports generated by the analysis.

## How to run

1. Create and activate a conda environment (Python 3.11 recommended):
   ```bash
   conda create -n archerfish python=3.11 -y
   conda activate archerfish
2. Install required packages:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn statsmodels pyyaml

3.Place your Excel file in the data/ folder.

By default, the script expects:

data/archer_dataAnalisy8.xlsx

4. Run the analysis:

python -m scripts.run_analysis --config config/config.yaml --outdir outputs


## Output
The script generates:

Learning curves: accuracy across sessions, one line per fish, grouped by target numerosity.

Bar plots: choice distribution across conditions (color × target).

Geometry/disposition plots: showing that non-numerical variables did not affect accuracy.

Report: a short REPORT.md summarizing the results.

All outputs are saved in the outputs/figures/ folder.
